We've been asked to use a linked list for this problem; the add_block method runs in constant time, as it takes the 
input data and added to the end of the linked list, while the space complexity will be O(n), as the space increased with 
the size getting larger. 

<h3> Time Complexity: </h3> 
<b>O(1);</b> adding a new node to the end of the linked list takes constant time

<h3> Space Complexity: </h3>
<b>O(n);</b> space will increase as the size getting larger
