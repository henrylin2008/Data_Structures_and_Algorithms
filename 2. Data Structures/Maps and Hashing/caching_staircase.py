# Problem Statement - (Recursion) - Repeat Exercise

# A child is running up a staircase and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Given that the staircase
# has a total n steps, write a function to count the number of possible ways in which child can run up the stairs.
#
# For e.g.
#
# n == 1 then answer = 1
#
# n == 3 then answer = 4
# The output is 4 because there are four ways we can climb the staircase:
#
# 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
# 1 step + 2 steps
# 2 steps + 1 step
# 3 steps
# n == 5 then answer = 13
def staircase(n):
    # Base Case - What holds true for minimum steps possible i.e., n == 1? Return the number of ways the child can
    # climb one step.

    # Inductive Hypothesis - What holds true for n == 2 or n == 3? Return the number of ways to climb them.

    # Inductive Step (n > 3) - use Inductive Hypothesis to formulate a solution

    if n == 1:
        return 1
    elif n == 2:
        return 2
    elif n == 3:
        return 4

    return staircase(n - 1) + staircase(n - 2) + staircase(n - 3)

def test_function(test_case):
    answer = staircase(test_case[0])
    if answer == test_case[1]:
        print("Pass")
    else:
        print("Fail")

# test cases
# test_case = [4, 7]
# test_function(test_case)  # Pass
#
# test_case = [5, 13]
# test_function(test_case)  # Pass
#
# test_case = [3, 4]
# test_function(test_case)  # Pass
#
# test_case = [20, 121415]
# test_function(test_case)  # Pass
