-Time: it will take to run the program
-Space: the amount of space the program will require in the computer's memory.
-An algorithm is essentially a series of steps for solving a problem. Usually, an algorithm takes some kind of input
 (such as an unsorted list) and then produces the desired output (such as a sorted list).
-space complexity, how efficient our algorithm is in terms of memory usage
