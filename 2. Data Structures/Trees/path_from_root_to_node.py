# Problem Statement
# Given the root of a Binary Tree and a data value representing a node, return the path from the root to that node in
# the form of a list. You can assume that the binary tree has nodes with unique values.

# You can use the following function to test your code with custom test cases. The function
# convert_arr_to_binary_tree takes an array input representing level-order traversal of the binary tree.
#
#                       1
#                     /   \
#                    2     3
#                   /      /
#                  4      5
#
# The above tree would be represented as arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, None, 5, None, None, None, None, None]
#
# Notice that the level order traversal of the above tree would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
#
# Note the following points about this tree:
#
# -None represents lack of node. For example, 2 only has a left node; therefore, the next node after 4 (in level order)
#  is represented as None
# -Similarly, 3 only has a left node; hence, the next node after 5 (in level order) is represented as None.
# -Also, 4 and 5 don't have any children. Therefore, the spots for their children in level order
#  are represented by four None values (for each child of 4 and 5)
