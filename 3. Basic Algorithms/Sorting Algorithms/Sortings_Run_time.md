<h3>Bubble Sort:</h3> Naive approach, compare items side by side 
- Worst case = O(n^2)
- Average case = O(n^2)
- Best Case = O(n)

<h3>Merge Sort:</h3> Divide and Conquer, split out the array, sort out the parts, and building it up again. 
- O(n log(n)) : ((# comparisons per step) (# steps))
- Auxiliary Space = O(n)
