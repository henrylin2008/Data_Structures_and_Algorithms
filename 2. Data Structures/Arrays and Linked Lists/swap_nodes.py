# Problem Statement
# Given a linked list, swap the two nodes present at position i and j, assuming 0 <= i <= j. The
# positions are based on 0-based indexing.
#
# Note: You have to swap the nodes and not just the values.
#
# Example:
#
# -linked_list = 3 4 5 2 6 1 9
# -positions = 2 5
# -output = 3 4 1 2 6 5 9
#
# Explanation:
#
# -The node at position 3 has the value 2
# -The node at position 4 has the value 6
# -Swapping these nodes will result in a final order of nodes of 3 4 5 6 2 1 9
#
# Let's take an example to understand a simple approach -
# Given linked list = [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1, 9]
# position_one = 2
# position_two = 5
# Note the original order of indexes - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
