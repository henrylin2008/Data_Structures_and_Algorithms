# Problem statement
# Given an array arr and a target element target, find the last index of occurrence of target in arr
# using recursion. If target is not present in arr, return -1.
#
# For example:
#
# For arr = [1, 2, 5, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4] and target = 5, output = 6
#
# For arr = [1, 2, 5, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4] and target = 7, output = -1
