# Coding Quiz: Check for Prime Numbers
# Prime numbers are whole numbers that have only two factors: 1 and the number
# itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7.
#
# For instance, 6 has four factors: 1, 2, 3, 6.
# 1 X 6 = 6
# 2 X 3 = 6
# So we know 6 is not a prime number.
#
# In the following coding environment, write code to check if the numbers provided in the list check_prime are prime
# numbers.
#
# -If the numbers are prime, the code should print "[number] is a prime number."
# -If the number is NOT a prime number, it should print "[number] is not a prime number", and a factor of that number,
# other than 1 and the number itself: "[factor] is a factor of [number]".
#
# Example output:
#
# 7 IS a prime number
# 26 is NOT a prime number, because 2 is a factor of 26

# Logic for our solution:
# -We loop through each number in the check_prime list.
# -Create a "search-for-factors" loop beginning at 2, and continuing up to the (number-1)
# -Use a conditional statement with the modulo operator to check if our number when divided by the possible factor
#  yields any remainder besides 0.
# -If we ever find one factor, we can declare that the number is not prime, and state the factor we found. Then we can
# break out of the loop for that number.
# -If we get up to the (number - 1) and haven't broken out of the loop, then we can declare that the number is prime.


check_prime = [26, 39, 51, 53, 57, 79, 85]

for num in check_prime:
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            print("{} is not a prime number, because {} is a factor of {}".format(num, i, num))
            break
        if i == num - 1:
            print("{} is a prime number".format(num))
