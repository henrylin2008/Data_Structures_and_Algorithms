DFS: Depth First Search

          /   \
        B       E
      /   \       \
     A     C        F

* Pre-Order: keep traversing from a parent to a leaf (keep traverse the left child, then right child)
    - D, B, A, C, E, F
* In-Order: from left to right
    - A, B, C, D, E, F
* Post-order: check off all of the descendant node/s before moving to the parent node
    - A, C, B, F, E, D

Binary Tree:
-Search: O(n)
-Delete: O(n) (worst)
-Insert: O(n) (worst)


Binary Search Tree (BST): every node on left is smaller than nodes on the right

Unbalanced BST: (worst case BST)
