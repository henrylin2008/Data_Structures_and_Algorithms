Arithmetic operators:
    + Addition
    - Subtraction
    * Multiplication
    / Division
    % Mod (the remainder after dividing)
    ** Exponentiation (note that ^ does not do this operation, as you might have seen in other languages)
    // Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer

Variables:
1. Only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores in your variable names. They can’t have spaces, and need to start
   with a letter or underscore.
2. You can’t use Python's reserved words, or "keywords," as variable names. There are reserved words in every
   programming language that have important purposes, and you’ll learn about some of these throughout this course.
   Creating names that are descriptive of the values often will help you avoid using any of these keywords. Here you can
   see a table of Python's reserved words.
3. The pythonic way to name variables is to use all lowercase letters and underscores to separate words.
