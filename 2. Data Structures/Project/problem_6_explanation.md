The Time and space complexity for union and intersection requires O(n), as it needs looping through the entire given 
lists, which is 2 x O(n), then converting the result into a list is another O(n), resulting in 3O(n), removing the
constant that leaves the result as O(n)

<h3> Time Complexity: </h3><b>O(n);</b> it requires to loop through both given lists

<h3> Space Complexity: </h3>
<b>O(n);</b> it requires to add up all of the given items in the both lists
