# Problem Statement
# Given a linked list with integer data, arrange the elements in such a manner that all nodes with
# even numbers are placed after odd numbers. Do not create any new nodes and avoid using any other data structure.
# The relative order of even and odd elements must not change.
#
# Example:
#
# linked list = 1 2 3 4 5 6
# output = 1 3 5 2 4 6
