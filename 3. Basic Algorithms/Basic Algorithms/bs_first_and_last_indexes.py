# Binary Search: first and last indexes
# Problem statement
# Given a sorted array that may have duplicate values, use binary search to find the first and last indexes of a
# given value.
#
# For example, if you have the array [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6] and the given value is 3, the answer will be [4,
# 6] (because the value 3 occurs first at index 4 and last at index 6 in the array).
#
# The expected complexity of the problem is  𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑛)) .
