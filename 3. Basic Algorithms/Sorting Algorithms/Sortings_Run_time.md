<h3>Bubble Sort:</h3> Naive approach, compare items side by side 
- Worst case: O(n^2)
- Average case: O(n^2)
- Best Case: O(n)

<h3>Merge Sort:</h3> Divide and Conquer, split out the array, sort out the parts, and building it up again
- Time Complexity: O(n log(n)) : ((# comparisons per step) (# steps))
- Auxiliary Space = O(n)

<h3>Quick Sort:</h3> pick a pivot point, then move numbers greater than the pivot point to its right, and move numbers 
less than the pivot point to its left. Repeat the process recursively until its sorted. 
- Worst case: O(n^2)
- Average/best case: O(n log(n))
- Space: O(1)
