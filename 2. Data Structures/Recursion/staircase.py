# Problem Statement

# Suppose there is a staircase that you can climb in either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps. In how many possible ways
# can you climb the staircase if the staircase has n steps? Write a recursive function to solve the problem.
#
# Example:
#
# n == 1 then answer = 1
# n == 3 then answer = 4
# The output is 4 because there are four ways we can climb the staircase:
#   1 step + 1 step + 1 step
#   1 step + 2 steps
#   2 steps + 1 step
#   3 steps
# n == 5 then answer = 13
